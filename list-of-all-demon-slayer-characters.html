While the series has 38 episodes, which is much shorter than a regular shonen, only six characters are featured in over 20 episodes of Demon Slayer series, with only one character appearing in 37 episodes.</p><p>Demon Slayer has been one of the most popular anime series since its TV premiere in 2019. This is not surprising considering the fantastic plot story, suspense, intense fight scenes, stunning visuals, and the plethora of demon slayer characters who have dazzled fans with their fascinating power and interesting personalities.</p><p>The series, which earned the “Best Anime” and “Anime of the Year” awards, presents the story of a young boy named Tanjiro Kamado who becomes a Demon Slayer after he returns home to find his entire family murdered save for his sister, Nezuko, who transformed into a demon.</p><p>This article presents the list of Demon Slayer characters in the animation series:</p><h2><strong>Demon Slayers Male Characters</strong></h2><h3><strong>1.
