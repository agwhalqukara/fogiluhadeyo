The soapie was created by Danie Odendaal and is set on the fictional street of 7de Laan (7th Avenue), a popular spot on the Hillside suburb, Johannesburg. Over the years, the show has done a great job in highlighting what a typical average South African passes through, from family struggles and relationships to employment. With its long list of outstanding actors and actresses, 7de Laan has quickly become one of the most beloved soapies in South Africa.</p><p>Interestingly, the show is originally done in the Afrikaans language. However, it also has subtitles in English, and sometimes a mix of Zulu language in-between. So far, it has completed over 5000 episodes and 22 successful seasons, garnering several awards and nominations in the process. The show has also witnessed a series of changes both on the main and recurring cast. That being said, below is the list of 7de Laan cast and the actors that play them.</p><h2><strong>7de Laan Main Cast and The Actors Who Play Them</strong></h2><h3><strong>Aggie Ngwenya-Meintjies played by Mimi Mahlasela</strong></h3><p>The Sowetan born Mimi Mahlasela joined 7de Laan since the year 2008, and she is currently one of the main actors on the show.

Before joining the show, Mimi attended the Tshwane University of Technology, where she studied drama. She has also appeared in other notable films such as <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mad Buddies</a> (2012) and <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">My Father’s War</a> (2016).</p><h3><strong>Alexa Welman played by Carina Nel</strong></h3><p>Carina portrays the character of Alexa Welman, a doctor who everyone runs to for help. The actress joined the cast of 7de Laan in 2019, and she has quickly become one of the most notable stars on the show following her ability to help those struggling with different issues.

However, it didn’t take long for the actress to wow the audience with her character, who is not just weird and wacky but also embraces life fully.
